# Machine Learning Methods for Invoice Information Extraction

This document outlines the machine learning techniques used in the invoice information extraction system.

## Architectures

### 1. LayoutLM-inspired Model with Transformer Architecture

Our system uses a LayoutLM-inspired model with transformer architecture to effectively process both textual and spatial information:

- **Transformer Blocks**: Multi-head self-attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on different parts of the document and establish relationships between text blocks based on their content and position.
  
- **Positional Encoding**: Custom positional encoding is added to input embeddings to help the model understand the relative positions of text blocks.

- **Bidirectional LSTM Layers**: Added on top of the transformer outputs to better capture sequential dependencies and improve the model's understanding of document flow.

- **Spatial Features**: We encode the bounding box coordinates (normalized x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max) to capture the spatial layout of text elements.

### 2. Relation Extraction with BiLSTM and Attention

Our relation extraction model uses:

- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Processes pairs of text blocks to understand their relationships and dependencies.
  
- **Attention Mechanism**: Helps focus on the most relevant parts of the sequence for relation prediction.
  
- **Layer Normalization**: Improves training stability and model performance.

## Feature Extraction

### Text Features

- **Text Embeddings**: Character-level and keyword features provide a basic representation of text content. In a production system, these would be replaced with pre-trained language model embeddings (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).

- **Text Length**: Normalized text length as a feature.

- **Keyword Indicators**: Binary features indicating presence of domain-specific terms like "invoice", "total", etc.

### Spatial Features

- **Normalized Coordinates**: Bounding box coordinates (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max) normalized to page dimensions.

- **Relative Positioning**: For relation extraction, we compute distances and relative positions between text block pairs.

## Training Process

The system supports training on annotated invoice data:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Models are trained using supervised learning with labeled invoice datasets.
2. **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.
3. **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.
4. **Validation**: Models are evaluated on validation sets to prevent overfitting.
5. **Bidirectional Learning**: The BiLSTM layers enable the model to learn context in both forward and backward directions.

## Self-Learning Capabilities

While not fully "unsupervised", the system has some self-learning capabilities:

1. **Attention Mechanisms**: Allow the model to learn which parts of the document are important for different tasks.

2. **Transformer Architecture**: Enables the model to establish relationships between document elements without explicit rules.

3. **Transfer Learning Potential**: The architecture supports fine-tuning from pre-trained models, allowing knowledge transfer from general document understanding tasks.

4. **Context Understanding**: BiLSTM layers help the model understand contextual relationships between different parts of the document.

## Entity Classification

Entities are classified using a combination of:

- **LayoutLM-based Classification**: Using both text content and spatial position to identify entity types.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Using spaCy for entity recognition, especially for named entities like people, organizations, dates.

## Multi-language Support

The architecture is designed to support multiple languages:

- The character-level features allow basic processing of different scripts.
- Spatial features are language-agnostic.
- The architecture can be extended with multilingual embeddings for improved performance.

## Future Improvements

1. **Pre-trained Embeddings**: Replace simple text features with pre-trained multilingual embeddings.
2. **Graph Neural Networks**: Add GNN components to better capture document structure.
3. **Self-supervised Pre-training**: Implement pre-training on unlabeled invoice data.
4. **Active Learning**: Implement a feedback loop where uncertain predictions are flagged for human review.
5. **Domain Adaptation**: Add components for adapting to different invoice layouts and templates.
